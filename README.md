### This is a simple app that predicts the sentiment of a greek phrase.

The model has been trained in covid-19 vaccine greek tweets with **Support Vector Machines** classifier. 
<br>The input is the text that the user types. 
<br>The output we get is whether the sentiment is positive, negative or neutral.
<br>For this project, I used Flask web framework, Python and some HTML and CSS for the front end of the page.
